# Leanathon 2025

## Proposal

### Learning objective

The goal of this course is to learn how to work with the Lean 4 theorem prover, in a capacity to _start formalization of new or existing work_. This includes:

- Writing domain specific data types (inductive and structural types)
- Write operations and semantics for and on these types
- Proof properties about these operations and semantics
- Write domain specific languages using Leans extensible syntax
- Make use existing theory, such as the extensive mathlib library

## Dates

We propose having joint interactive lectures and workshops (it is a leanathon after all) on **Tuesday mornings** and **Thursday afternoons** for three weeks starting 22/4. Please open issues or contact if you have any recommendations or comments about this or if it doesn't work for you!

| Date | Description  |
|------|--------------|
| 22/4 | Introduction |
| 24/4 | TBD          |
| 29/4 | TBD          |
|  1/5 | TBD          |
