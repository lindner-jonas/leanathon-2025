# Session 1 – Introduction
**Leanathon 2025**

_Tuesday 22/4 13.15 – B321 Room 033_

## Outline

Today we will learn a bit about what Lean is and what it can be used for.

We will work on small exercises and get familiar with defining functions, data types, and, writing proofs.

The goal of the Leanathon is to get introduced the to capabilities of Lean, learn the basics, and _encode some of your own research_ into Lean. You are therefor strongly encouraged to ask a lot of questions and work on the exercises and try out new stuff.

> My hope is that by the end of the course, you will have taken the first step of formalizing some _(even if small)_ part of your ongoing or past research in Lean!

Today starts this with the basics of Lean and in [session 2](w02.md) we will start modeling!
