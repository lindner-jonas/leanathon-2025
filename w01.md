# Session 1 ‚Äì Introduction
**Leanathon 2025**

_Tuesday 22/4 13.15 ‚Äì B321 Room 033_

## Outline

Today we will learn a bit about what Lean is and what it can be used for.

We will work on small exercises and get familiar with defining functions, data types, and, writing proofs.

The goal of the Leanathon is to get introduced the to capabilities of Lean, learn the basics, and _encode some of your own research_ into Lean. You are therefor strongly encouraged to ask a lot of questions and work on the exercises and try out new stuff.

> My hope is that by the end of the course, you will have taken the first step of formalizing some _(even if small)_ part of your ongoing or past research in Lean!

Today starts this with the basics of Lean and in [session 2](w02.md) we will start modeling!

## Exercises

_These are inspired by a [session given by Leo de Moura and David Thrane Christiansen](https://github.com/david-christiansen/ssft24/blob/main/README.md#lab-session)._

### 1. Installing Lean

The first step to using Lean is installation. Here we refer to the [official instructions](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html).

### 2. Opening a Lean file

You have two choices now:

1. Create a new Lean project:
    - After installing Lean create a new folder.
    - Go to this folder in a terminal and run `lake init`.
2. Clone this repository and work from there:
    - This repository contains a Lean project setup with some of the material for the exercises already in place.
    - Simply `git clone git@github.com:oembo-sse/leanathon-2025.git`, and then `code leanathon-2025`.
    - In the `Leanathon` folder you will find `E01.lean`.

### 3. Lists ‚õìÔ∏è

In this exercise we will define what is commonly referred to as linked lists or cons lists. These are available in Lean as `List`. They have a plethora of builtin function, but we will try and replicate some of them, to see how one works with these things!

1. Define a function `def all (l : List Œ±) (p : Œ± ‚Üí Bool) : Bool` that returns true if all the elements of `l` satisfy `p`. _(Hint: use `match l with ...`)_.
2. Define a function `def filter (l : List Œ±) (p : Œ± ‚Üí Bool) : List Œ±`.
3. Show that all elements of filtered list satisfy the filtered predicate. _(Hint: `theorem filter_all (l : List Œ±) (p : Œ± ‚Üí Bool) : (filter l p).all p := ...`)_
4. Define a function `def append (l‚ÇÅ : List Œ±) (l‚ÇÇ : List Œ±) : List Œ±` that puts one list in-front-of another.
5. Show that `filter (append l‚ÇÅ l‚ÇÇ) p = append (filter l‚ÇÅ p) (filter l‚ÇÇ p)`.
6. _Extra:_ Come up with operations or properties on lists that might be interesting. (eg. `def reverse`, `def repeat`, `inductive IsPalindrome`, `theorem append_reverse_IsPalindrome`)

### 4. Trees üå≥

In this exercise we will define binary trees, operations on them, and proofs about these operations!

1. Define an _inductive predicate_ `Tree` with a variant empty `leaf` and a variant `node` containing a left and a right child, and a natural number `Nat`.
2. Define a `Tree.toList (t : Tree) : List Nat` function that takes a tree and produces a list of the elements in the tree in order.
3. Define an inductive predicate `Tree.All : (Nat ‚Üí Prop) ‚Üí Tree ‚Üí Prop` that is true iff all elements of tree satisfy the given property.
4. Show that your `Tree.All` predicate is equivalent to `Tree.toList.all`.
5. Define an inductive predicate `Tree.Sorted : Tree ‚Üí Prop` such that empty trees are sorted, and branches are sorted if their left and right subtrees are sorted, all elements of the left subtree are less than or equal to the data item, and all elements of the right subtree are strictly greater than the data item.
6. Define a function `Tree.insert` that inserts an element into the tree. If the tree was sorted before, then it should be sorted after.
7. Show that `Tree.All` holds after inserting an element, iff it held before and for the new element.
8. Show that `Tree.insert` on a `Tree.Sorted` tree is `Tree.Sorted` after as well.
